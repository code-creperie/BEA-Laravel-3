      <p> 📖 Welcome to BEA, a friendly space where anyone can lend a book, borrow one, or just browse around. We believe that books are better when they’re shared—and that stories are made to travel. Whether you’re passing along a favorite novel, a dusty old textbook, or that one weird memoir you can't stop thinking about, BEA helps it find a new reader. We’re not a bookstore or a library—we’re a little bit of both, powered by people.</p>
